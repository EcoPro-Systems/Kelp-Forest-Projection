We created a free chat bot using an open source website that hosts large language models (LLM) called [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/). The assistant is designed to help users understand the result of our study and gives them an interactive way to ask questions. The assistant can also provide information about the data visualization, python scripts and the training process. The assistant uses a dynamic system prompts from this repo which provides the LLM with a set of instructions and background information it uses to answer questions.
