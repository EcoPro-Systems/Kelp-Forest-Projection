We created a chat assistant using an open source website that hosts models called [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/). The assistant is designed to help users understand the result of our study and gives them an interactive way to ask questions. The assistant can also provide information about the data visualization and the training process. The assistant is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use and can be updated via the system prompt. The system prompts provides the chat bot with a set of instructions and background information it can use to answer questions.
